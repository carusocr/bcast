Script to download youtube videos, including all videos from a user's channel. 

1. Script gets previous day's scouted youtube clips, builds hash of urls and uses db ids as fileroots.
2. Checks if any have the 'get channel' flag set, builds array of UNIQUE usernames.
3. Calls download_youtube for each download url in first array.
3a. Download method should first check data directory to make sure that output file doesn't exist.
3b. Downloads clip.
3c. Checks filetype, updates database with value.
4, For array of userchannel clips, need to make sure that none are already in db.
5. Once this is done, need to create vscout_url entry for each clip to be downloaded, BEFORE downloading.
6. After this is done follow steps 3a-3c.
7. Postprocessing happens later...codec, md5sum, duration. Maybe do it right after downloads?
